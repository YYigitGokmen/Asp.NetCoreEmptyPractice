Patika+ Fullstack Bootcamp Asp.NetCoreEmptyPractice


Practical - Asp.Net Core Empty
In this practice, you create an ASP.NET Core Empty project and organize the structures in the project in accordance with the MVC design pattern.

Ensure the following is added and configured to the structure:

Controllers Folder:

A component composition of controllers.

Models Folder:

Models are a combination of components.

Display Folder:

A combination of components in views.

wwwroot Folder:

A folder combination of wwwroot.

Then, using Program.cs files, we perform the following operations:

Adding MVC Services:

Add MVC application views and views as well as services required for the use of controllers.

Specifying the Use of Static Files:

We configure the configurations of static files located in wwwroot cells.

Routing Configuration:

Complete the routing work to ensure that the compatible message coming from the browser is directed correctly.

Default Routing:

Add a default redirect assembly for your homepage.

 Explain what the concepts of Controller - Action - Model - View - Razor - RazorView - wwwroot and builder.Build() - app.Run() methods are for, and for what purpose they are used, as a comment line at the bottom of Program.cs.
